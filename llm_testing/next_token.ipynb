revolution| will|iam| god|win| published| an| enquiry| concerning| political| justice| although| god|win| did| not| use| the| word| anarch|ism| many| later| anarchists| have| regarded| this| book| as| the| first| major| anarchist| text| and| god|win| as| the| founder| of| philosophical| anarch|ism| but| at| this| point| no| anarchist| movement| yet| existed| and| the| term| anarch|iste| was| known| mainly| as| an| insult| hur|led| by| the| bourgeois| gir|ond|ins| at| more| radical| elements| in| the| french| revolution| the| first| self| labelled| anarchist| pier|re| jose|ph| proud|hon| it| is| commonly| held| that| it| wasn| t| until| pier|re| jose|ph| proud|hon| published| what| is| property| in| one| eight| four| zero| that| the| term| anarchist| was| adopted| as| a| self| description| it| is| for| this| reason| that| some| claim| proud|hon| as| the| founder| of| modern| anarchist| theory| in| what| is| property| proud|hon| answers| with| the| famous| accusation| property| is| theft| in| this| work| he| opposed| the| institution| of| decre|ed| property| propri| t| where| owners| have| complete| rights| to| use| and| abuse| their| property| as| they| wish| such| as| exploiting| workers| for| profit| in| its| place| proud|hon| supported| what| he| called| possession| individuals| can| have| limited| rights| to| use| resources| capital| and| goods| in| accordance| with| principles| of| equality| and| justice| proud|hon| s| vision| of| an|archy| which| he| called| mutual|ism| mut|uell|isme| involved| an| exchange| economy| where| individuals| and| groups| could| trade| the| products| of| their| labor| using| labor| notes| which| represented| the| amount| of| working| time| involved| in| production| this| would| ensure| that| no| one| would| profit| from| the| labor| of| others| workers| could| freely| join| together| in| co| operative| workshops| an| interest| free| bank| would| be| set| up| to| provide| everyone| with| access| to| the| means| of| production| proud|hon| s| ideas| were| influential| within| french| working| class| movements| and| his| followers| were| active| in| the| revolution| of| one| eight| four| eight| in| france| proud|hon| s| philosophy| of| property| is| complex| it| was| developed| in| a| number| of| works| over| his| lifetime| and| there| are| differing| interpretations| of| some| of| his| ideas| for| more| detailed| discussion| see| here| max| stir|ner| s| ego|ism| in| his| the| ego| and| its| own| stir|ner| argued| that| most| commonly| accepted| social| institutions| including| the| notion| of| state| property| as| a| right| natural| rights| in| general| and| the| very| notion| of| society| were| mere| illusions| or| ghosts| in| the| mind| saying| of| society| that\n",
